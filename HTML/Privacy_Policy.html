This data does not directly identify you personally (such as by name or contact details), but may include information such as your IP address, browser version, device type and hardware model, operating system, language and locale settings, referring and exit URLs, approximate geographic location, pages visited, timestamps, clickstream patterns, and other technical diagnostics.

                            <li>Qyverra Technologies uses the personal information collected through our Sites for a range of business-related purposes. These purposes are based on one or more of the following legal bases: our legitimate business interests (“Business Purposes”), the performance of a contract with you or your organization (“Contractual”), compliance with legal or regulatory obligations, and/or your express consent where required. Specifically, we may use your information to fulfill and manage orders or service requests, contact you for feedback on your use of our services, and send you marketing or promotional communications—either directly or through trusted third-party partners—if such communications align with your indicated preferences. You may opt out of receiving such communications at any time.</li>

When Qyverra is engaged in a contractual relationship with you, your employer, or your organization, we may process personal data—typically limited to name, business contact details, and job title—in order to enter into, administer, and fulfill the terms of that contract. This may include tasks such as service delivery, financial reporting, auditing, or compliance with regulatory requirements. We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which it was collected, unless we are legally permitted or required to process it for another purpose without your knowledge or consent.</li>

                            Qyverra Technologies may process or share your personal data internally or with third parties—including service providers, partners, or affiliated entities—based on specific legal grounds. These include your consent, where you have explicitly authorized us to use your data for a defined purpose; legitimate interests, where processing is necessary for the operation or improvement of our business; contractual necessity, where we need to process your data to fulfill an agreement or service you or your organization has entered into with us; and legal obligations, where we are required to disclose data in compliance with applicable laws, regulatory authorities, court orders, or government requests. In certain cases, we may also share information to protect vital interests, such as preventing fraud, responding to security threats, or asserting our rights in the context of legal proceedings.
                            <br><br>
                            We may also disclose your personal information during corporate transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, sales of assets, financing, or in the event of a business restructuring, in accordance with applicable privacy laws.

                            “Third parties” may include service providers such as hosting providers, data storage vendors, analytics platforms, marketing partners, event organizers, contractors, consultants, and other professional advisors. These third parties are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of your data and are not permitted to use it for their own purposes. Data is shared only to the extent necessary to perform specific services on our behalf, and always under strict instructions aligned with this privacy policy and applicable law.
                            <br><br>
                            In some cases, your personal data may be transferred outside your country of residence or the country from which you access our services—including to jurisdictions such as India—for operational or processing purposes. Where such cross-border transfers occur, Qyverra implements appropriate safeguards to ensure that your data is handled securely and in compliance with the data protection laws of your jurisdiction. If you would like more information about these safeguards, you may contact us at [insert contact email].</p>

Once the data is no longer needed for these purposes and there is no ongoing legitimate business need to continue processing it, we will either securely delete or anonymize the information. In cases where immediate deletion is not feasible—for example, if the data is stored in backup archives—we will isolate and securely store the information, restricting it from any further processing until deletion becomes technically possible.</p>

As a result, Qyverra Technologies does not currently respond to DNT signals or any other automated browser-based mechanisms that communicate a preference not to be tracked online. Should an industry-standard protocol for online tracking be adopted in the future, and if we are required to comply with it, we will update this privacy policy accordingly and inform you of the change.</p>
